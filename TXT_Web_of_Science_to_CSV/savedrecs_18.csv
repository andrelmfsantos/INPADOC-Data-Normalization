ADVANTAGE - The nanobubbles have negative surface charges                which can reduce surface tension, release reactive                oxygen species, and facilitate surface modification                to carry antimicrobial compounds. The bubbles                attack and disrupt microbial biofilms, induce                oxidative stress, and reduces surface tension which                enhance biofilm removal from surfaces.

USE - The kit is useful for: testing a state of                immunization in a subject with respect to a                pathogenic microorganism in vitro (all claimed);                and treating other subjects severely affected by                the virus, preferably by the severe acute                respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. No biological                data given.    ADVANTAGE - The kit: allows to quickly and easily assess                whether the subject in question has acquired the                ability to defend himself from the virus or not;                evaluates the presence of antibodies, preferably                antibodies directed against the spike protein                (anti-spike), capable of counteracting or stopping                the progress of viral replication; allows viral                proteins in lyophilized or dried form to be stored                for a longer period of time and at room                temperature, compared to the case of supply of                viral proteins already in liquid solution; is                preferably designed to allow the use, as a starting                biological sample, of a saliva sample of the                subject, hence makes the carrying out of the test                quicker and less invasive, compared to the case of                a biological sample comprising blood obtained from                a finger-pricking device or from a classic                sampling; and is able to be perform even by                non-expert operators i.e. operators not necessarily                having the technical skills normally required for a                classic laboratory test.

USE - The method is useful for: treating a                coronavirus infection of a mammalian subject;                inducing type I IFN response in a mammalian subject                having a hematologic malignancy; enhancing a                mammalian immunogen-specific immune response; and                inducing type I IFN response in a mammalian subject                that presents with a microbial infection, or having                a cancerous tumor, where the mammal or mammalian                subject is a human, and the microbial infection is                a viral infection, a bacterial infection, a fungal                infection (all claimed), and parasite                infection. The ability of complex to treat viral                infection was tested in cultured human airway                epithelial cells (calu-3) cells by measuring cell                viability using in vitro assay. The result showed                that the 0.01 microM to 100 mM rose bengal                exhibited EC50 value of 0.015 microM after 48                hours.    ADVANTAGE - The method: utilizes HX molecule, which                exhibits immunotherapeutic properties in selected                oncology and virology conditions, and binds tightly                to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2                main protease, and utilizes short circulatory                half-lives of the HX compounds that facilitate                application of these molecules for acute STING                activation, and maximize innate immune system                signaling potential while avoiding chronic                activation that could lead to counterproductive                inflammatory response and possibly autoimmune                disease; and avoids potential onset of toxicity to                normal tissue.

The cage protein comprises a structural region                and a latch region, the latch region comprises at                least one target binding polypeptide, the cage                protein further comprises a first reporter protein                domain, the first reporter protein domain undergoes                a detectable change in reporting activity when                bound to a second split reporter protein domain,                and the structural region interacts with the latch                region to prevent solution access to the one or                more target binding polypeptide.    USE - The cage protein is useful for detecting                troponin I in a sample.    ADVANTAGE - The cage protein ensures accurate                detection.

COVID19                epidemic significantly impacted the higher                education industry and changed the traditional                classroom-based teaching-learning model to one                based on online instruction. The system is intended                to imply that changes to teaching, learning,                assessment, and feedback procedures affect their                structure and nature.

USE - System for predicting student result based on                educational data mining system.    ADVANTAGE - The system accurately predicts the marks so                that instructor modify their approach by laying                stress on slow and weak learners. The system                classifies results into pass and fail students                which will be used by instructors for making                desired decisions, instead to making many stages of                result generation, the results regarding pass/fail                can be obtained in a single stage. The authors                concluded that this model is used for a                multidimensional data so as to usage value of data                can be enhanced and the precision of prediction can                be improved. The system works upon providing timely                feedback to learners and teachers as well so that                appropriate steps may be taken for the betterment                of the learners.

The adapter for protection against air pollutants of all kinds, including viruses of the type Covid19, is provided for the detection, treatment and storage of respiratory components and their evaluation, as required, separately according to inhalation and exhalation or only after inhalation or exhalation, which is stored on an easily exchangeable storage medium for further treatment. The separation of inhalation and exhalation through one-way valves or similar measures separate air ducts is available in the form of hollow bodies in any shape and any material for fixed or easily replaceable connection to a conventional protective mask.    USE - Mask adapter used as add-on module for respirator of conventional or special design, such as FP1 mask and for protection against air pollutants of all kinds, such as viruses of the type Covid19.    ADVANTAGE - The reliable quality statement is hardly possible, and a uniform quality standard is excluded due to the large number of participants, different handling and evaluation from the sample name to the transmission of the result. All steps are carried out apart from the handling of the mask by the mask wearer himself, according to a uniform standard without the possibility of accidental or intentional external intervention. The gripping hand is contaminated with viruses at any time without risk or consequences. The frequent delays or limitations when capacities are exceeded, which are eliminated by continuous sampling when using the protective mask. The accumulation of viruses on the outer surface of the mask is avoided due to largely uninhibited air flow and continuous virus killing within the adapter. The cumulative measurement of components in the air in the manner of a dosimeter for radioactivity through their reactions with reagents or duct wall coatings within the respective air duct and the biochemical and digital storage of the result values is determined on an easily exchangeable storage medium. The lowest possible air resistance for inhalation and exhalation is mainly achieved through the design without the use of mechanical filtering through fleece and textiles. The easier breathing and general use of the mask result in greater acceptance of wearing the mask and greater overall safety. The exclusive and controlled inhalation and exhalation is made through the adapter while avoiding leaks between the mask and face. The source of each individual is provided in order to initiate the most important measures to destroying/killing the virus. The continuous dosimeter-type testing/measuring of radioactivity is provided using an adapter connected to the protective mask.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Virus Family Detection Mobile App which enables mobile phone to detect whether the surface is contaminated with microbes such as coronavirus of 120 nm/0.12 mu m, or needs decontamination, comprises many microdroplets comprising single nucleic acid template and many species of primer pairs, each species of primer pairs being specific for different target site, where each of the single nucleic acid templates in the microdroplets comprise one of the different target sites that is recognized by only single species of primer pairs, where the single species of the primer pairs binds to the target site of the single nucleic acid template in each microdroplets. The microbes undetectable with mobile phone are detected by some other instruments. Surface decontamination is effectively done by sanitizer and or UV-C. The size of the mobile imaging platform is (23x 10x 7 cm) 0r (22x 9x 6 cm) (lengthx widthx height). With this platform, a digital enzyme assay of bovine alkaline phosphatase is successfully completed. The digital influenza virus counting based on a fluorogenic assay for neuraminidase activity of the virus is demonstrated. The lower detection efficiency is due to its relatively lower signal-to-noise ratio than that found with conventional microscopes, and unavoidable intrinsic heterogeneity of neuraminidase activity among virus particles. The digital influenza virus counting with the mobile imaging platform still showed 105 times greater sensitivity than that with a commercial rapid influenza test kit. Virus detection of clinical samples was also successfully demonstrated, suggesting the potential to realize a highly sensitive point-of-care system for influenza virus detection with smartphones and also the human beings can check whether a surface is contaminated by corona virus or virus and then take appropriate action Similarly, the dose of sanitization or UV pulse light can be fixed.

WO2021206897-A1;  US2021319229-A1;  EP4133404-A1,"Video analysis system for determining physical            information from video frame, has processor that            calculates physical distance between first object and            second object and generates distance alert based on            physical distance",SUBRAMANIAN G;  CELI J,SENSORMATIC ELECTRONICS LLC (SENS-C);  SENSORMATIC ELECTRONICS LLC (SENS-C);  SENSORMATIC ELECTRONICS LLC (SENS-C),2021B6621Y,"   NOVELTY - The video analysis system (100) has a                processor that is in communication with a memory to                receive the frames from a video stream (106). A                first object and a second object within the frames                are identified. A physical distance between the                first object and the second object is calculated                using a distance determination model that uses a                first size of a first bounding box around the first                object to determine a first depth component of a                first set of coordinates for the first object and                that uses a second size of a second bounding box                around the second object to determine a second                depth component of a second set of coordinates for                the second object. A distance alert is generated                based on the physical distance.    USE - Video analysis system for determining physical                information from video frame and/or counting                objects in video stream for generating distance                alert to avoid transmission and spread of viruses                such as COVID19.    ADVANTAGE - The system provides improved accuracy and                improved efficiency to such scenarios, and may                generate distance alerts and object count alerts                based on configurable settings. The retailers are                allowing shoppers inside a store in a controlled                fashion by manually checking the occupancy status                in the store and by manually checking social                distancing constraints, so that shoppers are safe                while shopping due to health concerns to avoid                transmission and spread of viruses. The systems                that allow for determining a physical distance                between objects in one or more frames of a video                stream and generating a distance alert, and/or for                counting objects in one or more frames of a video                stream and generating an object count alert. The                system switches between separate models that are                separately trained with data collected during                daytime and nighttime hours for model selection                based on time of day, which should yield better                results than a combined model.

The agent has                adhesion strength adequate to maintain the                prosthesis temporarily in place or else unsupported                against the tissue in the absence of setting/curing                of agent. The prosthesis is adhered against the                surface of tissue by adhesion strength. The agent                is solution and gel that includes water and                components consist of glycerin, sodium                carboxymethylcellulose, maltrodextrin, hypromellose                and xantham gum.    USE - Method for implanting surgical mesh prosthesis                e.g. C-QUR mesh (RTM: polypropylene mesh with Omega                three gel coating manufactured by Atrium Medical                Corporation Hudson), MOSAIC mesh (RTM: Omega three                fatty acid coated polypropylene mesh manufactured                by Atrium Medical Corporation, Hudson) and Parietex                PROGRIP mesh (RTM: laparoscopic self-fixating                monofilament polyester mesh manufactured by                Tycol/Covidien) against targeted tissue location of                surgical site during surgical hernia repair.    ADVANTAGE - The positioning agent loaded surgical mesh                prosthesis is an implantable device that is removed                and replaced, or easily slid and repositioned on                the targeted tissue upon application of an external                force without traumatizing the targeted tissue. The                amount of time spent measuring and marking the                patient and mesh is minimized while enabling an                improperly positioned mesh to be repositioned                without damaging the tissue. The prosthesis is                prevented from being slid on the tissue surface                without abrading, tearing, ripping, severing,                shearing, or otherwise damaging the tissue to which                it is bonded or over which it slides by the glues                and other similar adhesives create a strong bond                with tissue during a surgical procedure. The                patient time in the operating room is reduced by                minimizing or eliminating the requirement for a                surgeon to measure and mark the patient and the                surgical mesh prosthesis to ensure that the                implanted device is centered correctly over a                hernia or other tissue defect. The prosthesis is                easily be repositioned at an optimal location over                the hernia or other tissue defect by sliding the                prosthesis along the hernia or tissue defect                without requiring lengthy measuring and marking.                The risk of long term tissue adhesions due to                inadvertent contact with the viscera is minimized                when prosthesis is removed away from the tissue at                the site of the hernia or defect and replaced into                a different position.

US2014088583-A1;  WO2014209440-A1;  US9173707-B2,"Coaptive surgical sealing tool used for e.g. open            surgery, has spring that is formed between back            sections of arms, so as to urge back sections of arms            away from each other and electrodes that are positioned            on jaws",SINGH G,SINGH G (SING-Individual);  CITY OF HOPE (CITY-C);  CITY OF HOPE (CITY-C),2014F93591,"   NOVELTY - The surgical tool (10) has the arms (12,14)                that are pivotally attached to each other. A finger                ring (18) is positioned on the back section of each                arm. A spring (26) is formed between the back                sections of arms, so as to urge the back sections                of arms away from each other. The jaws (24) having                a length of 5 to 9 cm are positioned on the front                section of arms. The electrodes (30) are positioned                on the jaws. An irrigation port is positioned on                the first arm connected to an irrigation line                leading to irrigation fluid outlets in or adjacent                to the electrode.    USE - Coaptive surgical sealing tool for use with                radio frequency (RF)/bipolar cautery generator                including Triad-Covidean Ligasure Generator, ConMed                generator or Enseal generator for open surgery and                laparoscopic surgery.    ADVANTAGE - By incorporating the spring and the                electrodes, the tool can be provided in different                sizes for different caliber of vessels, while                sliding into the liver parenchyma without tearing                the larger blood vessels and hence the occurrence                of the tearing of larger blood vessels can be                prevented, and is safe to use for major hepatic                resection with minimal post-operative adverse                events. The design of the tool can be simplified.                The tool can be supplied at low cost. The tool can                be enabled to reduce parenchymal transection times                in excess of 50%. The occurrence of the char can be                reduced by supplying an irrigation fluid to the                cautery site. The need for frequently stopping the                procedure to clean char from the jaws can be                reduced.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a                surgical method.

A                vacuum port (30) is affixed to the cover layer to                establish fluid tight seal about an opening in the                cover layer, where the vacuum port includes a                hollow interior in fluid communication with the                opening in the cover layer and a barbed connector                to facilitate connection to a vacuum source (50). A                packing member (20) is affixed to the cover layer,                fills the wound, and supports the cover layer when                negative pressure is applied to the                reservoir.    USE - Composite gauze pad/non-woven wound dressing                i.e. Covidien (RTM: antimicrobial dressing)                Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Foam wound dressing,                for use in negative pressure wound therapy system                for a wound patient.    ADVANTAGE - The cover layer acts as a microbial barrier to                prevent contaminants from entering the wound and as                a fluid barrier to maintain integrity of vacuum                reservoir. The dressing allows a release liner to                be adhered to adhesive at a peripheral region of                the cover layer to protect the adhesive and the                packing member prior to use of the dressing. The                dressing has a cellulose serving as stiffening                agent to provide rigidity to fingers to facilitate                handling and placement of the dressing, so that the                fingers are transitioned to a soft and pliable                configuration to promote patient comfort, thus                promoting healing by reducing probability of                infection and stimulating deposition of granulation                tissue.
