Remote rehabilitation is performed on a cloud telemedical platform COVIDREHAB, using a device suitable for unobstructed Internet access and video communication in real time. First, patient leaves online application on platform portal for remote rehabilitation, filling a set of questionnaires, attending physician checks completed questionnaires: health assessment, mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council), SF-36, and determines indications and contra-indications for remote rehabilitation in accordance with information received from patient. If, in the process of filling out the questionnaires, the patient indicates a symptom that is dangerous or critical for life and health, patient immediately receives notification from attending physician on in-person seeking of medical care. According to results of patient filling questionnaires and analyzing available information on patient's condition, attending physician through portal of telemedicine platform opens the patient access to set of medical recommendations in form of links to Internet resources with remote sessions with an instructor of physical therapy (PT), as well as with information materials or video lections, placed on the same portal and relating, in addition to PT, recommendations for nutrition, intestinal microflora recovery and drug-free posttraumatic recovery methods, or in accordance with the patient's condition, sends a message on the need for an in-person visit to the doctor. As rehabilitation measures, patients undergo a distance rehabilitation course for 20 days: 14 days of online sessions with a PT instructor and according to the indications with a psychologist, in a group or individually, and 6 days of self-study on video lessons. At that, as PT sessions, diaphragmatic breathing is taught to patients in online classes led by an instructor, after which they perform complex exercises of respiratory gymnastics using diaphragmatic breathing under video surveillance of instructor. In the sitting and standing positions, a complex of general strengthening exercises with respiratory exercises elements is performed, including power and aerobic exercises of increasing intensity. After each session, the patients fill the PT activity tolerance questionnaire, according to the results of which either continue this course, or the physician directs them a link to the passage of another PT complex, in accordance with their tolerability. Remote online sessions for 14 days are daily, each consisting of consecutive blocks: first 5 minutes of diaphragmatic breathing, then 40 minutes of PT, including respiratory gymnastics, then patients fill the PT activity tolerance questionnaire and send it through platform portal to attending physician, sessions with psychologist according to indications, consultation of the attending physician on dynamics of the patient's state with making a decision on continuation of the current rehabilitation complex or on the complex replacement in accordance with patient's tolerance. At end of 14th session, the patient refills the set of questionnaires used before the rehabilitation, and sends them through the platform portal to the attending physician to assess the health state dynamics, by results of which the physician directs the patient to the recommendations of the video lessons for independent rehabilitation continuation or change of PT complexes, respiratory exercises, the corresponding psychological effect, diet, wherein the duration of each video lesson with independent exercise by the patient of the corresponding exercises does not exceed 30 minutes.

Therefore, they have begun to rush to buy medical masks, which has caused insufficient production capacity at this stage. The number of masks worn by the front-line medical staff is also very tight. If the anti-epidemic time is prolonged, I fear that the raw materials will be insufficient. Therefore, it is conceived that the use can be repeatedly cleaned and can isolate most of the droplets and aerosol transmission methods.

The input images are                processed by deep neural network algorithms for                making intelligence decision of the condition of                disease and to know the status of the disease as                positive or negative. The image is captured from                mobile devices due to lighting from the camera. The                light changes the color of the captured tongue and                eye images. The extracted infected region pixels                are clustered together on similarity with the                neighborhood pixels.    USE - Diagnosis system for analyzing tongue and eye                image using internet of things (IOT) based android                application.    ADVANTAGE - The system enables different users to access                the application without training, reduces the                examination cost of COVID19 disease diagnosis. The                android application reduces the task of physicians                to handle a huge number of people diagnoses without                any difficulties. The external symptoms of COVID 19                diagnosed through the tongue and eye images improve                the accuracy of prediction. The image processing                techniques through deep learning improves the                accurate prediction of infected regions. The fundus                camera attached to mobile devices and processed                through the proposed algorithms save the vision.                The portable system is accessed without any human                interventions.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic view of the                diagnosis system through android application                interface.

The thermal image                (004) is converted into false color-coded thermal                image. The False color coded thermal image is then                converted into hue saturation value (HSV) color                space to extract the V component. A V component is                extracted from false color coded infrared image and                is mixed with the intensity corrected greyscale                visible image. The ratio of mixing ensures that the                scene details are visible in the resultant image                and the fused image is the new value component                (VNEW) which is then combined with the original H                and S components and converted back to red, green,                blue (RGB) color space and the resultant image is                the final fused RGB image.

The EMS store includes EMS for selecting one EMS.                The selected EMS indicates the emotion, mental, and                physical state of a user. The ExRx prescriber                pushes to a user device a stored ExRx coupled to                the selected EMS from the EMS store. The ExRx may                be a long-form, periodic, or episodic message or                content with a behavioral and physical (b/p)                recommendation specific to the user's HBS. The HBS                is the isolation or varying grade of                quarantine.    USE - System for delivering ExRx based on selected                EMS and HBS.    ADVANTAGE - Provides a new and useful system that delivers                an ExRx based on EMS or HBS by imposing a dynamic                sentiment vector to an electronic message. Applies                a vibration pattern to the direct message before                the direct message is delivered to the second user,                based on the user's mood or expression. Delivers                carefully curated and efficacious content to the                user to combat the defined EMS of the user.                Generates a more dynamic assessment, allowing for                more hyper-personalized digital content delivery.                Ensures that specially reconfigured and curated                content may be accessed on one's personal digital                device to mitigate the protracted mental health                fallout from COVID-19 or any other natural or                social phenomena.

The specified biomarker is an                antibody, antigen or nucleic acid component of or                for a coronavirus.    USE - Device for extracting a filtrate from a liquid                sample.    ADVANTAGE - The advantage of capillary-driven flow is that                the mechanics of the system can be very simple and                automatic. The liquid flows through the initial                channel and into the collection channel that                eventually flow past these stop junctions, allowing                them to be wetted through from the side of the                collection channel, thus eliminates the air-liquid                barrier and causing the capillary forces preventing                the liquid from moving forward to disappear.

A first sensor is supported                with the first person, where the first sensor moves                with the first person. Condition present in an area                with the first sensor is quantified as digital                content to associate a first time indicator with                condition. An user interface is generated, where                the user interface comprises a physical position of                the first person and the quantified condition                present in the area (106). The user interface is                updated to indicate conditions present in the area                and respective positions of persons at specified                times. Conditions are designated to avoid a safety                risk based upon safety risk triggering an alarm                state.    USE - Method for tracking safety conditions of a                person in a defined area such as a building or a                construction site.    ADVANTAGE - The method enables increasing resolution of                laser scanning to include generation of data based                upon LIDAR techniques, so that influence of a                number of date points can be reduced within a                selected RTA, thus performing pattern recognition                and determination of an orientation of a smart                device based upon LIDAR data such as image data                based on pattern recognition. The method enables                quantifying environmental conditions during time of                close contact to access quantified environmental                conditions to determine whether a viral contagion                such as COVID 19 will spread from a sick person to                a healthy person. The method enables obtaining                virtue of determination of positional coordinates                associated with the first and second person, so                that a standard metrics can be obtained to                determine distance between the first and second                person by using a coordinate scheme. The method                enables obtaining entry of coordinates and                essential credentials to provide access to content                associated with positional coordinates.

USE - The method is used for photo-eradication of                microorganisms from target comprising cells                infected by the microorganisms or an environment                contaminated with the microorganisms, where the                microorganisms comprise one of a bacteria, a virus                and fungi (all claimed). The method is used for                photo-eradication of microorganisms from food under                storage or transport conditions that is                contaminated with microorganisms. The method is                used to provide treatment for diseases, disorders                or conditions of a region of skin, tissue or a                wound and for treatment of bacterial infection,                fungal infection and viral infection. The bacterial                infection includes acne, psoriasis, cellulitis,                erysipelas, erythrasma, folliculitis and skin                abscesses, hidradenitis suppurativa, impetigo,                ecthyma, lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, necrotizing                skin infections, staphylococcal scalded skin                syndrome, wound and tissue infections such as                osteomyelitis. The viral infection includes severe                acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (CoV),                2019-nCoV, human coronavirus 229E, bat coronavirus                HKU9-1, H1N1, norovirus and feline calicivirus,                influenza virus type A, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63.                The fungal infection includes tinea capitis, tinea                corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis and tinea                unguium. Test details are described but no results                given.    ADVANTAGE - The method allows for improved device                performance with reduced battery requirements, a                substantial reduction in treatment time, and                improved patient safety due to a significant                reduction in heat and optical hazard. The method                reduces effect of light and reduces the oxygen                molecule to a highly reactive singlet state. The                mechanism of microorganism suppression or                eradication is broad spectrum and is applicable to                various types of microorganisms. The method                provides a more effective way to sanitize and                extend shelf life of food and prevents bacterial                transmission to humans and animals. The low levels                of light are very safe to the eye. The method                provides a significant advantage over continuous                wave light sources that deliver light at high                irradiance and radiant exposures.

USE - The immunogenic hMPV modified F protein is                useful for: generating an immune response to the                respiratory tract infection in a human subject;                treating or preventing the respiratory tract                infection in the human subject, where the subject                is at risk or has at least one respiratory tract                infection, preferably hMPV, RSV, PIV3, influenza                and/or coronavirus infection; and preventing and/or                treating the hMPV infection in the human subject                (all claimed). The ability of the protein to treat                hMPV infection was tested in mouse sera using                neutralization assay. The results showed that the                0.06-6 mu g recombinant F protein (comprised of                L7F-A1-31 protein i.e. (SEQ ID NO: 7) and IC31                (RTM: Novel adjuvant combines immunostimulatory                effects of an 11-mer antibacterial peptide and a                synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide) exhibited IC50                value of 409 (not defined).    ADVANTAGE - The immunogenic hMPV modified F protein: binds                a specific anti-pre-fusion human monoclonal                antibody (MPE8) and binds very poorly or does not                bind a specific anti-post-fusion muscle fast                C-protein 1 antibody; is capable of eliciting a                neutralizing antibody recognizing the native hMPV F                protein; avoids immunogenic side-effects from a                heterologous sequence; and has a stable pre-fusion                conformation.

A filter for blocking pathogenic microorganisms is installed at the air inlet. The air outlet is connected with a negative pressure device (5). The filter for blocking pathogenic microorganisms is installed at the air outlet. The negative pressure device is connected with the outlet end of the filter at the air outlet. One-way valves are installed at the air inlet and the air outlet. The filter is located at the outer end of the one-way valve.    USE - Anti-pollution mask without resistance.    ADVANTAGE - The anti-pollution mask distinguishes the airway into and out, and the negative pressure device is connected to the rear end of the filter outlet at the air outlet, which ensures that there is no resistance increase in normal breathing movement. The mask is beneficial to protect the original normal drainage method of the human body and reduces the secondary inhalation of pathogenic microorganisms. The filters are added for pathogenic microorganisms at the air inlet and air outlet to filter the incoming and exhaled air, which prevents the entry of external infection sources and the pollution of the exhaled air to the outside world. The mask is especially suitable for people suffering from respiratory tract transmission and worn for mild patients with infectious diseases (various viral and bacterial infectious diseases including the new coronavirus).

USE - The method is useful for (a) treating COPD or                lung condition in a mammal or (b) producing                non-human mammalian model for COPD. The lung                condition is chosen from COPD, asthma, pulmonary                fibrosis, sarcoidosis, disease caused by infection,                and their combinations. The disease caused by                infection is chosen from a viral infection, a                bacterial infection, a fungal infection, a                parasitic infection, and their combinations. The                viral infection is chosen from viral pneumonia,                viral bronchitis, influenza, coronavirus infection,                adenovirus infection, syncytial virus infection,                rhinovirus infection, and their combinations (all                claimed).    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the                following: (1) a non-human mammalian model of COPD,                where the somatic cells of non-human mammalian                model comprise nucleic acid encoding one or more                human-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotypes,                where the somatic cells of non-human mammalian                model lack expression of endogenous major                histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules                and endogenous interleukin (IL)-17 polypeptides,                where the model has a decrease in lung function as                compared to a compared to a comparable model not                exposed to cigarette smoke, when exposed to                cigarette smoke for 2-6 weeks; (2) a method (M2) of                producing non-human mammalian model for COPD,                involves providing non-human mammal, where the                somatic cells of non-human mammalian comprise                nucleic acid encoding one or more human HLA                serotypes, where the somatic cell of non-human                mammalian model lack expression of endogenous MHC                class II molecules and endogenous IL-17                polypeptide, and exposing the mammal to cigarette                smoke for 3-6 weeks; and (3) a method (M3) for                treating lung condition in a mammal involves                administering a composition comprising live or                killed Prevotella, live or killed P.melaninogenica,                or vesicles of a Prevotella species.

A face mask portion (2) is attached to side edge of the layer of the flexible and foldable material in the longitudinal or widthwise extension. The face mask portion is detachably connected to the layer made of flexible and foldable material. The face mask portion is connected to the layer made of flexible and foldable material by means of buttons, by means of press studs. The face mask portion has means for attaching it to a head of a wearer of the face mask portion. The bendable and foldable material of the face mask portion is a textile.    USE - Flat structure such as hand, bath or sauna towel used in areas where people are little or not dressed and carry most essential items.    ADVANTAGE - The forgetting or losing a mouth and nose cover or a face mask is counteracted. The portion between the bands serves to cover the mouth and nose of a wearer. The opening of the molded pocket is directed upward when the face mask portion is hanging from the rest of the sheet, so that items stored in the pocket are not fall out. The multi-layer or double-layer face mask portion has several layers ensure greater protection against infections, for example in times of a pandemic. The shaped pocket enables the face mask portion to be used as such. A key or drink is carried in the pocket when the face mask portion is not required to cover the mouth, nose or other face portions. The favorable arrangement of the face mask portion on the layer of the planar structure results from the fact that the faces mask portion is attached to the side edge of the layer, which is the longer in length and width. The face mask portion is arranged on the upper side edge of the folded sheet-like structure and is easily folded up and fastened to the head of the wearer, even more versatile arrangement of planar structure and face mask portion with respect to one another. A wearer optimally uses the flat structure for himself according to his wishes and, for example, wears a sauna towel adapted to himself and his body and use the face mask portion attached to the flat structure regardless of worn. Buttons or press studs ensure, in a simple manner, a secure and permanently stable connection between the flat structure and the face mask portion. The requirement of covering the mouth and nose is avoided. The forgetting or losing a mouth and nose cover or a face mask is counteracted.

Preferably: (a)                the PB1 gene segment encodes a PB1 protein having                an amino acid sequence comprising selected amino                acids, where the selected amino acids comprise a                leucine at position 40 and a tryptophan at position                180, and at least one of an asparagine at position                464 or a serine at position 607, and where the PB1                gene segment optionally comprises a cytosine to                uracil promoter mutation at nucleotide position 4;                and (b) the PB2 gene segment encodes a PB2 protein                having an amino acid sequence comprising selected                amino acids, where the selected amino acids                comprise a valine at position 504, and optionally                an isoleucine at position 467 and a valine at                position 529, and where the PB2 gene segment                optionally comprises a cytosine to uracil promoter                mutation at nucleotide position 4.    USE - The influenza virus or pharmaceutical                formulation is useful for eliciting an immune                response in a mammal, preferably human (claimed);                and for preventing or treating an influenza                virus.    ADVANTAGE - The virus has enhanced growth as compared to                an influenza virus that is the same except without                the selected amino acids in Vero cells under the                same conditions. The backbone of influenza virus                confers high growth properties onto influenza                viruses, particularly in Vero cells, regardless of                the type of influenza virus (e.g. seasonal or                pandemic influenza viruses). The influenza virus                exhibits high yields even in manufacturing                processes using low multiplicity of infection (MOI)                (e.g. 0.001).

ADVANTAGE - The fabric: achieves enhanced efficacy of the VICs of the drugs coated on the fabric using sonochemical methods (ultrasonic nano-coating) of the cotton the material; has natural biological agglutinating properties of the agent (plant protein) and its innate antiviral potency acts as a booster and the adsorption of bodily fluids (saliva, sweat) onto the fabric matrix acted as added conjugants heightening the antiviral activity of the two approved drugs coated on our fabric mask invention, all of which proved advantageous, in that, the lower titres of viruses (encountered in ambient air) are significantly suppressed by 80-100% due to the protein and drugs bi-layer coating on the fabric mask; achieves practicable viral suppressive measures by wearing an antiviral coated cloth mask and can provide a simple means to alleviate the distress of economically challenged people in who are finding it increasingly difficult to follow strict social distancing in the situation of virus (e.g. COVID-19) pandemics; utilizes drug assisted cloth mask that is a scientifically tested option which is economically affordable too than either of the existing practices of cloth (atmospheric particulate pollution) mask and face covering by inadequate fabrics unfit for purpose, or an out of reach, unaffordable expensive choice of high end nanofiber fitted filters; utilizes sub-lethal concentrations of the two approved drugs coated on the masks that provide cheaper effective personal protection for individuals from viral incursion from breathing ambient air and also the the sub-lethal antibiotics adhered on the mask fabric can be regarded as non-toxic, compliant to health and safety of the user perspectives.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for bulk manufacturing (industrial upscaling) of the fabric based mask, achieving enhanced efficacy of the viral inhibitory concentration (VICs) of the drugs coated on the fabric using sonochemical methods (ultrasonic nano-coating) of the cotton the material and can be used for making apparels worn by healthcare professionals as personal protection equipment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Performing closed intelligent internal processing disinfection and sterilization process involves using disinfection and sterilization equipment. The main body frame of the disinfection and sterilization equipment is composed of an equipment housing (1), a partition (2), an air outlet pipe (11), an air inlet pipe (12) and a nozzle (14). The air outlet pipe and the air inlet pipe are set outside the equipment casing. The air outlet pipe is equipped with a ceramic heat pipe (13). The nozzle (14) is surrounded by bristles (15), and the nozzle (14) sprays dry steam containing ozone at 60-80 degrees C through the air outlet pipe. The surface of the object is cleaned, after the object is cleaned by dry steaming. The mixed gas containing virus and bacteria is sucked into the initial sterilization chamber in the equipment. The initial sterilization chamber is filled with disinfectant, and the liquid is enclosed in the chamber. The floating ultrasonic vibration generator is used to makes the disinfectant form a mist in the warehouse. The air containing virus and bacteria are entered in the warehouse through the air inlet pipe and mixed with the mist of the disinfectant to kill viruses and bacteria. The bacteria-containing air that has been mist-killed by passing disinfectant through the filter, and water droplets below 0.0750mm float on the upper portion of the secondary sterilization chamber. The microwave generator is installed on the top of the secondary sterilization chamber emits a microwave field effect with a frequency of 2450 plus minus 50MHz, which makes the virus and bacterial cells subject to shock and vibration. The outer structure of the cell is destroy and increased the permeability of the cell, and destroy the material balance inside and outside the cell. The inactivation of viruses and bacteria are realized at the same time the quantum effect in the microwave field stimulates water molecules to produce H2O2 and other free radicals to form cytotoxicity. The ultraviolet emitter is installed on the top of the secondary sterilization chamber to automatically adjust the power intensity of the 260nm light wave to irradiate the virus, bacteria and microorganisms in the water mist to destroy the structure of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the body and made it immediately death or loss of the ability to reproduce, resulting in the death of growth cells and regenerative cell death, and achieved the effect of killing viruses and bacteria. The turbo blower is pressurized and sent to the ozone generator to reduce the water in the air and ozone to produce peroxide, after the ozone and H2O2 react with the disinfectant, decomposed and reduced to water, and heated at 80 degrees C and sprayed out by a porcelain heat pipe.

The                first chimeric polypeptide and second chimeric                polypeptide in first multi-chain chimeric                polypeptide associate through binding of the first                domain and second domain of pair of affinity                domains in first multi-chain chimeric polypeptide,                and the first target-binding domain and second                target-binding domain in first multi-chain chimeric                polypeptide binds specifically to a receptor of                IL-18 or a receptor of IL-12. The second                multi-chain chimeric polypeptide comprises a first                chimeric polypeptide comprising a first                target-binding domain, a linker domain, a first                domain of a pair of affinity domains, and a second                chimeric polypeptide comprising a second domain of                a pair of affinity domains, and a second                target-binding domain. The first chimeric                polypeptide and second chimeric polypeptide in                second multi-chain chimeric polypeptide associate                through binding of first domain and second domain                of the pair of affinity domains in second                multi-chain chimeric polypeptide. The first                target-binding domain and second target-binding                domain in second multi-chain chimeric polypeptide                binds specifically to a receptor for IL-7 or a                receptor for IL-21, and IgG1 antibody construct                comprises antigen-binding domain that binds                specifically to linker domain.

USE - The nucleic acid is useful for virus that                infects and kills lumpsucker fish (C.lumpus),                treating fish infected with a virus, and detecting                virus in a biological sample from fish. The virus                is an enveloped virus, preferably a Coronavirus, or                a Torovirus. The infection of lumpsucker fish by                virus causes tissue damage in intestine, and/or                diarrhea symptoms in fish (all claimed). The                nucleic acid is used for treating disease caused by                the virus.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the                following: (1) virus that infects and being capable                of killing lumpsucker fish (Cyclopterus lumpus)                comprising a virus genome comprising a sequence of                the nucleic acid, where the nucleic acid sequence                comprises base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T);                (2) oligonucleotide primer comprising a sequence of                at least 9 nucleotides, where the sequence is                complementary to a nucleic acid sequence which is                comprised within the genome of virus, and comprises                at least 9 consecutive nucleotides of a sequence                which is complementary to, a portion of a reference                nucleic acid sequence chosen from SEQ ID NOs: 1-5                or a 24613 base pair sequence (SEQ ID NO: 6) fully                defined in the specification or at least 9                nucleotides of sequence which is at least 80%                identical to a sequence which is complementary to a                sequence chosen from SEQ ID NOs: 12-20; (3) method                for detecting a virus that infects and capable of                killing fish involves (i) contacting a nucleic acid                extracted from a biological sample of a fish with                at least 1 oligonucleotide primer to form a                mixture, and (ii) determining whether upon                subjecting the mixture of (i) to amplification an                amplification product is present, or (b) sequencing                a nucleic acid extracted from a biological sample                of a fish, and (ii) comparing the resulting nucleic                acid sequence with a nucleic acid sequence which is                complementary to, a reference sequence chosen from                SEQ ID NOs: 1-6, where an at least 80% sequence                identity between the 2 sequences indicates the                presence of the virus in the biological sample, at                least one oligonucleotide primer is complementary                to a nucleic acid sequence which is comprised                within the genome of the virus, and the presence of                amplification product indicates the presence of RNA                associated with the virus, and hence the presence                of the virus in the biological sample, and the                oligonucleotide primer is an oligonucleotide                primer; (4) antibody binding a polypeptide encoded                by a nucleic acid sequence which is comprised                within the genome of the virus, where the                polypeptide is chosen from (i) a polypeptide                comprising an amino acid sequence which is at least                80% identical to a 5867 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID                NO: 7) fully defined in the specification, (ii) a                polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence which                is at least 80% identical to a 1391 amino acid                sequence (SEQ ID NO: 8) fully defined in the                specification, (iii) a polypeptide comprising an                amino acid sequence which is at least 80% identical                to a 260 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 9) fully                defined in the specification, (iv) a polypeptide                comprising an amino acid sequence which is at least                80% identical to a 201 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID                NO: 10) fully defined in the specification, and (v)                a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence                which is at least 80% identical to a 113 amino acid                sequence (SEQ ID NO: 11) fully defined in the                specification; (5) kit for detecting a virus in a                biological sample from fish, comprising an                oligonucleotide primer and/or an antibody, where                the kit is a real-time reverse transcription                (RT)-PCR assay; (6) vaccine comprising a nucleic                acid of a sequence which is comprised within the                genome, a nucleic acid of a sequence which is                sequence of nucleic acid comprising SEQ ID NOs:                1-6, a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid                sequence which is comprised within the genome of                the virus; and (7) interfering RNA (iRNA) molecule                comprising at least 12 nucleotides of, or                complimentary to, a nucleic acid sequence comprised                within the genome of the virus. acactataccagcccatg                (SEQ ID NO: 12), caagcaacagtttaagtgag (SEQ ID NO:                13), tgtgaggtagcaaagacg (SEQ ID NO: 14),                gtgttcttactgtggttgg (SEQ ID NO: 15),                cattagggcatatcgaagggtc (SEQ ID NO: 16),                tgagttccagcaagtagag (SEQ ID NO: 17),                tcaaaactctcaacctcaac (SEQ ID NO: 18),                aagatgtaatactggcaaaa (SEQ ID NO: 19), and                acgactcctaaacctgaag (SEQ ID NO: 20).

The lysis buffer                solution is adapted to, within 15 minutes of being                combined with a mucosal sample: lyse Haemophilus                influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus                pneumoniae cells within the mucosal sample to                extract antigens specific to the H. influenzae, M.                catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae cells.    USE - The lysis buffer solution is useful for lysing                H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae                cells within mucosal sample to extract antigens                specific to the H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and                S. pneumoniae cells; for concurrently detecting                multiple pathogens from a single nasal mucosal                sample; and for concurrently detecting H.                influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae,                influenza A, and influenza B from a mucosal sample                (all claimed).    ADVANTAGE - One of the advantages of a lysis buffer than                can lyse/extract antigens for viruses and bacteria                is that a patient's sample can be combined with a                single buffer solution to form a single sample                solution for running the assay, thus simplifying                and reducing errors during the collection process.                Further, the same patient sample can be used to run                bacterial and viral assays, thus providing results                under better controlled conditions compared to                assays run with different samples (even if from the                same patient). The particular composition (and                combination) of lysing agents can be effective at                quickly and gently lysing the multiple different                types/classes of viruses without disrupting the                antigens or their ability to be recognized by the                antigen binding agents used in, for example, a                lateral flow assay. The devices may accurately and                quickly (with a minimum of discomfort) allow the                acquisition of a mucus sample from the middle                meatus region of the sinus (while avoiding                miss-targeting of the region and                cross-contamination).

USE - The method is useful for treating a subject                diagnosed as having a neurocognitive disorder (NCD)                i.e. major NCD that interferes with subject's                independence and/or normal daily functioning or                mild NCD that does not interfere with subject's                independence and/or normal daily functioning. The                NCD is associated with impairment in one or more of                complex attention, executive function, learning and                memory, language, perceptual-motor function, and                social cognition and is not due to delirium or                other mental disorder. The NCD is a frontotemporal                NCD or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and                is due to a lysosomal disease e.g. neuronal ceroid                lipofuscinosis (NCL). The FTLD or NCL is                PGRN-associated FTLD or NCL. The PGRN-associated                FTLD is behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia                variant of FTLD, semantic dementia variant of FTLD                or progressive nonfluent aphasia variant of FTLD.                The PGRN-associated NCL is Batten disease (all                claimed). The NCL include infantile variant e.g.                Santovuori-Haltia disease (SHD), late infantile                variant e.g. Jansky-Bielschowsky disease (JBD) and                the adult variant e.g. Kuf's disease (KD).
